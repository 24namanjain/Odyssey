# Docker Introduction

Docker is a platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

## Benefits of Docker

1. **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.
2. **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers.
3. **Isolation**: Containers run in isolation from each other, ensuring that dependencies and configurations do not conflict.
4. **Efficiency**: Containers share the host system's kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start compared to traditional virtual machines.
5. **Version Control**: Docker images can be versioned, allowing developers to track changes and roll back to previous versions if needed.

## How Docker Works

1. **Dockerfile**: Developers write a Dockerfile, which contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image.
2. **Docker Image**: The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image, which is a snapshot of the application and its dependencies.
3. **Docker Container**: A running instance of a Docker image is called a container. Containers can be started, stopped, and managed using Docker commands.
4. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry service where Docker images can be stored, shared, and downloaded.

By using Docker, developers can ensure that their applications run consistently across different environments, streamline the development process, and improve deployment efficiency.
